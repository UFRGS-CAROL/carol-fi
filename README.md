# carol-fi_cuda-parallel 


CAROL-FI CUDA is an cuda-gdb based fault injector. 
CAROL-FI GDB Fault Injector should work on any recent machine with cuda-gdb.

# Requeriments

- NVIDIA GPU, tested with Kepler, Maxwell, Pascal, and Volta architectures 
- CUDA GDB (installed with CUDA drivers)
- Python 2.7
- Libpython2.7 sudo apt install libpython2.7


# How to run a simple test

To test simple_add run the make into the simple_add folder '/codes/simple_add'.

<ol>
<li>First step is the profiler</li>

```{r, engine='bash', code_block_name} 
$ ./app_profiler.py -c codes/simple_add.conf
```

</ol>


 A folder into /tmp directory will be created with the binaries and files needed.
 
 

Then, to run the fault injector use the following command:

```{r, engine='bash', code_block_name} 
$ ./fault_injector.py -c ./codes/simple_add/simple_add.conf -i 10
```

The fault injector will run quicksort 10 times and, the logs will be stored in the *logs* folder

## Configuration files

A configuration file can have several sections, each section (except the DEFAULT section) will specify one fault injection to be performed by CAROL-FI. The DEFAULT section contains information that will be used by every other section.

### DEFAULT section

The DEFAULT section contains the following keys:

* debug - Print additional information in the log files generated by CAROL-FI

* gdbExecName - How to run gdb, you can use the absolute path or execute a specific version of gdb. Usually, you can set the value to 'gdb'

* faultModel - Which fault model to use: 0 -> Single; 1 -> Double; 2 -> Random; 3 -> Zero; 4 -> Least Significant Bits (LSB)

* injectionSite - Where fault will be injected, only RF (Regsiter File) currently working

* maxWaitTimes - This value will be multiplied by the average program execution time to determine if app hanged or not.

* benchmarkBinary - Where the binary file is located, generally at the same folder of the sources

* benchmarkArgs - The args of your program must be  in one line only

* csvFile - CSV output file. It will be overwrite at each injection

* goldenCheckScript - Compare script path. You should create a script to verify the gold output vs. injection output.

* seqSignals - How many SIGINT signals to send to the application, your application cannot use this signal

* initSleep - Wait time to start sending signals. Generally, wait time for memory allocation and cudaMemcpy (in seconds).

You can see an example of a DEFAULT section below:

```

[DEFAULT]

debug = False

gdbExecName = /usr/local/cuda/bin/cuda-gdb

faultModel = 0

injectionSite = RF

maxWaitTimes = 5

benchmarkBinary = /home/carol/carol-fi/codes/micro_mp_hard/cuda_micro_mp_hardening

benchmarkArgs =  --verbose --iterations 10 --precision double --redundancy dmrmixed --inst compose

csvFile = ./fi_micro_compose_dmrmixed_double_single_bit.csv

goldenCheckScript = codes/micro_mp_hard/sdc_check.sh

seqSignals = 20

initSleep = 0

```

## Fault Models
Currently, we have 5 fault models implemented:

* (0) Single - flips only one bit from all the bits that compose the data
* (1) Double - flips two bits from all the bits that compose the data
* (2) Random - replaces all the bits from the data by a random bit
* (3) Zero - replaces all the bits by zero
* (4) Least Significant Bits (LSB) - flips one bit from the first byte of the data

## Injection sites
Currently, we have only RF injection site implemented:

* RF - Register File
* INST_OUT - Instruction Output (NOT IMPLEMENTED YET)
* INST_composed -> Instruction Adress (NOT IMPLEMENTED YET)
