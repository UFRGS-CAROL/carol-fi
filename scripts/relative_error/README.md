# Scripts to compute and plot relative error

R and ggplot2 must be installed. For Ubuntu users: sudo apt install r-base-core r-cran-ggplot2

The Makefile has one rule to parse, process, and plot data from MxM logs (make mxm). One rule for the HotSpot application (make hotspot). There is al
so one rule to build both (make all).

The scripts process_mxm.py and process_hotspot.py will read the log files (mxm-errors.log and hotspot-errors.log) and generate a CSV file to be parsed by R scripts.

The R script createErrLimitsTableforPlot.R will read the CSV file generated before and produce a table for how many of the corrupted execution can be considered correct for a certain amount of tolerable errors.

Finally, lineGraph.R will use the table generated by createErrLimitsTableforPlot.R and plot the data into a PDF file.
